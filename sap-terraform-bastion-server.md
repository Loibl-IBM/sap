# Automate SAP bastion server â€“ SAP media storage repository 
{: #sap-bastion-server} 

This task describes how to do an automated deployment of SAP bastion and storage setup on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. It shows how to deploy an IBM Cloud Gen2 VPC with a bastion host with secure remote SSH access. In SAP Terraform and Ansible deployments, the bastion host is used to give external administrative access to the other servers and applications. The bastion server is accessed through the Floating IP. The bastion server includes a customizable security group and subnet to enable access to the same region zones on its dedicated SAP/DBs and the VSI's IPs and ports. The Floating IP also allows the bastion host access to the internet so the sap and DB kits can be downloaded. 

Before you decide which SAP automated solution you want to deploy in IBM Cloud VPC, run the bastion server automated deployment. You need to specify the amount of dedicated storage that is needed to download and store the SAP kits. The SAP kits are used to deploy wanted SAP solution from the IBM Cloud VPC automated SAP solutions pool. The bastion server in IBM cloud is primarily used for SAP solution deployment. It can be used as a Jump Host, for example, to maintain and administer all SAP solutions within its respective IBM Cloud VPC region.

Each customer is given an SAP S-user that reflects their contractual details with SAP, including: 
* SAP support
* SNotes 
* System maintenance 
* Generate and maintain SAP and DB licenses  
* Migrations keys 

It is the customer's responsibility to download and prepare the necessary SAP kits from [SAP launchpad support](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/) and store them on the dedicated and customizable storage. The SAP kits are used during automated deployment when Ansible is called.

## Solution implemented
{: #bastion-solution-implemented}

The Bastion server is used for remote software installation by using Terraform remote-exec and Ansible playbooks that are run by Schematics.

The Terraform modules implement a 'reasonable' set of best practices for bastion host configuration only. Your own Organization might have more requirements that you must apply before the deployment.

It contains:
*	Terraform scripts for deploying a VPC, Subnet, Security Group with rules, a volume, and a VSI.
*	Bash scripts to install the prerequisites for SAP BASTION&STORAGE VSI and other SAP solutions.

### VPC Configuration
{: #sap-bastion-vpc-config}

The Security Rules are:
*	Allow all traffic in the Security group
*	Allow all outbound traffic
*	Allow inbound DNS traffic (UDP port 53)
*	Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP port 22)
*	Option to Allow inbound TCP traffic with a custom port or a range of ports.

### VSI Configuration
{: #sap-bastion-vso-config}

The VSI is configured with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 (amd64), has a minimal of two SSH keys that are configured to be accessed by the root user and one storage volume. 

### Software configuration
{: #sap-bastion-software-config}

*	Terraform - an open source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp
*	Ansible - an open source software provisioning and configuration management tool.
*	The IBM Cloud Command Line Interface provides commands for managing resources in IBM Cloud.

|OPEN_PORT_MINIMUM	(Required, Integer) |The TCP port range that includes the minimum value. Valid values are 1 - 65535. |
|OPEN_PORT_MAXIMUM	(Required, Integer) | The TCP port range that includes the maximum value. Valid values are 1 - 65535.|
|VPC	| The name of the VPC. View the list of available VPCs on the IBM Cloud Console [Virtual private clouds](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/vpcs) page.|
|SUBNET	|The name of the Subnet. View the list of available Subnets on the IBM Cloud Console [Subnets] (https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/subnets) page.|
|SECURITYGROUP	| The name of the Security Group. View the list of available Security Groups on the IBM Cloud Console [Security groups for VPC page](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/securityGroups).|
|HOSTNAME	|The hostname for the VSI. The hostname must have up to 13 characters.|
|PROFILE	|The profile used for the VSI. For more information about profiles, see [Instance profiles](docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles&interface=ui). Default value: "bx2-2x8".|
|IMAGE	|The OS image used for the VSI. For more information about available images, see [Virtual server images](docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images). Default value: ibm-redhat-8-4-minimal-amd64-1.|
|SSH_KEYS	|List of SSH Keys IDs that are allowed to SSH as root to the VSI. Can contain one or more IDs. View the list of available SSH Keys on the IBM Cloud Console [SSH keys for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/compute/sshKeys) page. Sample input (use your own SSH IDs from IBM Cloud): [ "r010-57bfc315-f9e5-46bf-bf61-d87a24a9ce7a", "r010-3fcd9fe7-d4a7-41ce-8bb3-d96e936b2c7e" ]|
|VOL1 [ number ]|	The size for the disk in GB to be attached to the BASTION VSI as storage for the SAP deployment kits. The mount point for the new volume is: "/storage". Default value: 100 GB.|

## Before you begin
{: #sap-bastion-before-begin}

1.  To complete this procedure, you need a general understanding of IBM VPC and VSIs. To run the example in IBM Cloud Schematics, you need an IBM Cloud account. The deployed resources are chargeable.

2.  [Create or retrieve an IBM Cloud API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key). The API key is used to authenticate with the IBM Cloud platform and to determine your permissions for IBM Cloud services.

3.	Be sure that you have the [required IBM Cloud IAM permissions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-user-permissions-for-vpc-resources) to create and work with VPC infrastructure and you are [assigned the correct permissions](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access) to create the workspace and deploy resources.

4.	[Generate an SSH key](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys). The SSH key is required to access the provisioned VPC virtual server instances through the bastion host. After you create your SSH key, make sure to [upload this SSH key to your IBM Cloud account](/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-ssh-keys#managing-ssh-keys-with-ibm-cloud-console) in the VPC region and resource group where you want to deploy the bastion server.

5.  Verify that you can access the URL used for this solution [Automation script for SAP solutions using a BASTION & STORAGE setup deployment through Terraform and IBM Schematics](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-bastion-setup). 

6.  Check the readme file for the version of Terraform to use.
