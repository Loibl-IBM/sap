# Creating a single-tier Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with NW7.X and Db2 on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using Terraform and Ansible
{: #create-terraform-nw-db2-vpc-ansible}

Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} enables predictable and consistent provisioning of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure resources so that you can rapidly build complex, cloud environments. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware using Intel Xeon CPUs and additional Intel technologies.
{: shortdesc}

You can use Terraform scripts to create a single-tier Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and create the SAP and Db2 infrastructure on the VPC. The Terraform scripts create the VPC and then call the Ansible playbook to create the SAP architecture on the VPC. The recommended place to run the scripts is on your Deployment Server. The Deployment Server needs to have Terraform and Ansible installed. 
{: shortdesc}

## What is created
{: #terraform-nw-db2-components}

The scripts work in two phases. The first phase automates the VPC provisioning process. The second phase creates the SAP architecture.

During the first phase, the VPC is provisioned with these components: 

*	1 VPC where the virtual server instance is provisioned
*	1 security group. The rules for this security group allow:
    - Inbound DNS (port 53) and 
    - Inbound SSH (TCP port 22) connections to your virtual server instance 
    - All outbound traffic from the virtual server instance
*	1 subnet to enable networking in your VPC
*	1 virtual server instance with SAP certified storage and network configurations
*	1 floating IP address that you use to access your VPC virtual server instance over the public network

During the second phase, the Ansible Playbook is called and the SAP architecture is installed. The SAP architecture that is deployed is NetWeaver 7.X with Db2. For more information about this architecture, see [SAP NetWeaver 7.x on UNIX with Db2 on VPC IBM Cloud](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-refarch-nw-db2)

The scripts are designed to create a new VPC and install SAP in one task flow. If you want to install SAP NW7.X and Db2 on an existing VPC, see [Deploy NW7.X and Db2 on an existing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} VPC by using Terraform and Ansible](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-terraform-nw-db2-existing-vpc).  


## Script files
{: #terraform-nw-db2-ansible-files}

The configuration and script files are provided on the GitHub repository [`https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-netweaver-abap-db2-standard`](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-netweaver-abap-db2-standard)

To run the scripts to create a VPC and install NW7.X and Db2, you modify:

*	The `terraform.tfvars` file to add your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API-key.
*	The `input.auto.tfvars` file to customize the resources for your solution. By default, the VSI is configured with:
    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux&reg; 7.x for SAP Applications (amd64), 
    - Two SSH keys that are configured to access as root user on SSH, 
    - Five storage volumes. 
  
    You can change the default settings to match your solution. 

    You can change the default SAP system configuration settings to match your solution. You also specify the location where you downloaded the SAP kits.
    
All of the other configuration files are provided and do not need to be modified. 

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses these configuration files to provision a VPC in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. 

## SAP Kits
{: #terraform-nw-db2-create-vpc-sap-kits}

For each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} allocates temporary storage on a dedicated Jump host. It is your responsibility to download the necessary SAP and DB kits to your Deployment Server. There are three files that you must manually decompress, the other files are decompressed by Ansible. For more information, see the `README` [file](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-automated-deployment-scripts/tree/master/sapsingletierdb2). 

## Support
{: #terraform-nw-db2-support}
 
There are no warranties of any kind, and there is no service or technical support available for these materials from {{site.data.keyword.IBM}}. As a recommended practice, review carefully any materials that you download from this site before using them on a live system.

Though the materials provided herein are not supported by the IBM Service organization, your comments are welcomed by the developers, who reserve the right to revise, re-adapt or remove the materials at any time. To report a problem, or provide suggestions or comments, open a GitHub issue.

## Before you begin
{: #terraform-nw-db2-ansible-before}

Before you use the scripts:

*  Log in to your Deployment Server and verify that Terraform and Ansible are installed.  

*  If you have not already, create a bastion server to store the SAP kits.  For more information, see [Automate SAP bastion server - SAP media storage repository](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server).

*  Download the SAP kits from the SAP Portal to your Deployment Server. Make note of the download locations. You must decompress the `kit_export_dir`, `kit_db2_dir`, and `kit_db2client_dir` files. Ansible decompresses the rest of the files. For more information, see the `README` [file](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-automated-deployment-scripts/tree/master/sapsingletierdb2). 

*  [Create or retrieve an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key). The API key is used to authenticate with the IBM Cloud platform and to determine your permissions for IBM Cloud services.

*  [Create or retrieve your SSH key ID](/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-getting-started-tutorial). You need the 40-digit UUID for the SSH key, not the SSH key name.

## Procedure

Use these steps to configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in and use Terraform to create a VPC for SAP. The scripts can take 2 hours to complete. 

1.  Log in to the Deployment Server by using `ssh`.

2.  Clone the `terraform` and `ansbile` folders and `README` file from `https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-netweaver-abap-db2-standard` and change to the `sap-netweaver-abap-db2-standard/terraform` folder.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-netweaver-abap-db2-standard.git
    
    $ cd sap-netweaver-abap-db2-standard/terraform
    ```

3.  Edit the ``terraform.tfvars`` variable file and enter the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key that you retrieved. 

    ```ibmcloud_api_key = "<ibmcloud_apikey>"```

    Variables that are defined in the `terraform.tfvars` file are automatically loaded by Terraform when the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in is initialized and you can reference them in every Terraform configuration file that you use.  

    Because the `terraform.tfvars` file contains confidential information, do not push this file to a version control system. Keep this file on your local system only. 
  
4.	Define your VPC. Modify the `input.auto.tfvars` file to specify your zone, VPC component names, profile, and image. You need your 40-digit SSH key ID for this file. The second SSH key is optional. For more options for profile, see [Instance Profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles). For more options for image, see [Images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images). For descriptions of the variables, see the `README` [file](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-automated-deployment-scripts/tree/master/sapsingletierdb2).

    ```
    #Infra VPC variables
    ZONE			= "eu-de-2"
    VPC			= "sap"
    SECURITYGROUP		= "sap-securitygroup"
    SUBNET			= "sap-subnet"
    HOSTNAME		= "db2saps1"
    PROFILE			= "bx2-4x16"
    IMAGE			= "ibm-redhat-7-6-amd64-sap-applications-1"
    SSH_KEYS		= [ "r010-57bfc315-f9e5-46bf-bf61-d87a24a9ce7a" , "r010-3fcd9fe7-d4a7-41ce-8bb3-d96e936b2c7e" ]
    VOL1			= "32"
    VOL2			= "32"
    VOL3			= "64"
    VOL4			= "128"
    VOL5			= "256"
    ```

5. Customize your SAP system configuration. In the same file, `input.auto.tfvars`, edit the SAP system configuration variables that are passed to the Ansible automated deployment. 

    For descriptions of the variables, see the `README` [file](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-automated-deployment-scripts/tree/master/sapsingletierdb2). 
    
  
    ```
    ##SAP system configuration
    sap_sid	= "NWS"
    sap_ci_instance_number = "00"
    sap_ascs_instance_number = "01"

    #Kits paths
    kit_sapcar_file = "/storage/NW75DB2/SAPCAR_1010-70006178.EXE"
    kit_swpm_file =  "/storage/NW75DB2/SWPM10SP31_7-20009701.SAR"
    kit_saphostagent_file = "/storage/NW75DB2/SAPHOSTAGENT51_51-20009394.SAR"
    kit_sapexe_file = "/storage/NW75DB2/SAPEXE_800-80002573.SAR"
    kit_sapexedb_file = "/storage/NW75DB2/SAPEXEDB_800-80002603.SAR"
    kit_igsexe_file = "/storage/NW75DB2/igsexe_13-80003187.sar"
    kit_igshelper_file = "/storage/NW75DB2/igshelper_17-10010245.sar"
    kit_export_dir = "/storage/NW75DB2/51050829"
    kit_db2_dir = "/storage/NW75DB2/51051007/DB2_FOR_LUW_10.5_FP7SAP2_LINUX_"
    kit_db2client_dir = "/storage/NW75DB2/51051049"
    ```

    Remember, you must manually decompress the `kit_export_dir`, `kit_db2_dir`, and `kit_db2client_dir` files. Ansible decompresses the rest of the SAP kit files. For more information, see the `README` [file](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-automated-deployment-scripts/tree/master/sapsingletierdb2).
    {: note}  


6. Initialize the Terraform CLI. 

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

7. Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are done to create the virtual private cloud instance in your account.      

   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

   You must enter an SAP master password.

   The SAP master password must be 10 to 14 characters long and contain at least one digit (0-9). It can only contain the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, #, $, _. This password cannot contain `!`. It must not start with a digit or an underscore ( _ ).

8. Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the ``input.auto.tfvars`` file to correct resources and run ``terraform plan`` again.

9. Create the virtual private cloud for SAP instance and IAM access policy in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

    ```
     terraform apply
     ```
     The virtual private cloud and components are created and you see output similar to the `terraform plan` output.  

10. Add the SAP credentials and the virtual server instance IP to the SAP GUI. For more information about the SAP GUI, see [SAP GUI](https://help.sap.com/doc/7abd5470728810148a4b1a83b0e91070/1511%20000/en-US/frameset.htm).

## Next steps

If you need to rename your resources after they are created, modify the ``input.auto.tfvars`` file to change the names and run ``terraform plan`` and ``terraform apply`` again. Do not use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard and user interface to modify your VPC after it is created. The Terraform scripts create a complete solution and selectively modifying resources with the user interface might cause unexpected results. 

If you need to remove your VPC, go to your project folder and run ``terraform destroy``.
